## Data
This project uses the following three datasets:

1) effort 1997 to 2012 transect surveys for model_June2018.csv
Description: This file contains information on each transect that was surveyed (listed by surveyID) durig the two time periods of our analysis (1997-2004 and 2006-2012). The file contains the date and time that each transect was surveyed as well as if the survey occured during the am or pm (ampm), the length surveyed (Meters), number of people who participated (People), and the number or person minutes (Pminutes). This file was used in both the community occurrence model as well as the composition analysis.

2) snake 1997 2012 dataset for body condition analysis_June2018.csv 
Description: This file contains a list of every snake encountered during both standardized surveys (i.e., those in the effort file) as well as those observed opportunistically during the two time periods of our analysis (1997-2004 and 2006-2012). When it was possible to capture snakes, their snout-to-vent lenght (SVL; cm) and mass (g) was recorded. Note that not every sample has these data available and that efforts to capture snakes to collect this information increased post-epizootic. This data file was used for the body condition analysis.

3) snake 1997 2012 dataset for body condition analysis_June2018.csv  
Description: This file contains a list of each snake encountered during the standardized surveys (i.e., the surveys listed in the effort file by surveyID) during the two time periods of our analysis (1997-2004 and 2006-2012). Each row represents a detected individual, its species and the date, time, and transect on which it was observed. This file was used in both the community occurrence model as well as the composition analysis.
